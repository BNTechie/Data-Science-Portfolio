üîó **[GitHub Repository](Projects/Alzheimers-Research)**  

### **Summary**

This study combined single-cell electrophysiology and proteomics to investigate aberrant protein expression and hyperexcitability in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons. The study aimed to correlate electrophysiological abnormalities with proteomic alterations, uncovering novel therapeutic targets.

Your Contribution:
Your role involved data analysis, bioinformatics integration, and interpretation of results linking proteomic alterations to hyperexcitable neuronal phenotypes. You contributed to the linear regression and mediation analysis framework to establish causal relationships between protein expression and neuronal dysfunction.

Technical Skills:

Bioinformatics (STRING Reactome pathway analysis, gene ontology enrichment)
Mediation analysis to infer causal relationships
High-dimensional data visualization and statistical modeling

Key Findings:

The study identified ~1,400 proteins correlated with neuronal hyperactivity in AD, including key upregulated proteins such as Clusterin (CLU), Calreticulin (CALR), and Apolipoprotein E (APOE). Mediation analysis suggested that dysregulated proteins drive hyperexcitability rather than the other way around. These findings highlight novel targets for AD therapy.

Multiclass Classification of Environmental Chemical Stimuli from Unbalanced Plant Electrophysiological Data
Project Summary:
This study focused on classifying three different environmental chemical stimuli (Sodium Chloride, Sulfuric Acid, and Ozone) based on plant electrophysiological responses. A comprehensive machine learning pipeline was developed to analyze unbalanced plant signal data, extract statistical features, and compare the performance of multiple classifiers. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also employed to assess classification accuracy in reduced feature spaces.

Your Contribution:
You played a key role in data processing, feature engineering, and benchmarking classification models. Your contributions included implementing multiclass classification approaches, applying Monte Carlo under-sampling techniques, and evaluating classifier performance using confusion matrices and statistical tests.

Technical Skills:

Machine learning models for multiclass classification (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN, AdaBoost)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
Handling unbalanced datasets using Monte Carlo under-sampling
Performance evaluation metrics: F1-score, balanced accuracy, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient
Hypothesis testing with MANOVA for statistical significance
Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas
Key Findings:
The study demonstrated that the Adaboost classifier in the original 15D feature space achieved the highest classification performance across all three environmental stimuli. PCA did not significantly improve classification accuracy, reinforcing the complexity of plant signal responses to chemical stress. These results highlight the potential of plant electrophysiological data in environmental pollution monitoring and precision agriculture applications.

I'll now generate relevant visualizations for this study to be included in your portfolio.
